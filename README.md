I made the concept a bit different and I would like to explain why ;
The first reason is obvious, to stand out and showcase my out box of thinking as much as my skills ,
and the second reason is I ended up chosing this way because I didn't know how to change colors of a running horse gif,
the static horse just gliding didn't come natural so I chosed a theme that support the idea of gliding natural, hence
flying broomPlayers üòÑ


With additional development time, I would implement:

*Winner Celebration Animation
As soon as a race ends, display a central, full-screen animation (confetti, spotlight, trophy reveal, etc.) highlighting the horse (or rider) that crossed the finish line first.
Live Results & League Standings



*Connect the frontend to a real-time database via a backend API. Fetch each race‚Äôs results, persist them, and render an ongoing ‚Äúleague table‚Äù or championship leaderboard so users can track season standings.
Weather-Driven Performance Tuning



*Integrate a weather API to pull current conditions (rain, snow, wind). Tag each horse with weather-specific strengths (e.g. ‚Äúperforms best in rain,‚Äù ‚Äúexcels on snow‚Äù). Dynamically adjust their speed and stamina per race based on the live forecast.
Dynamic Weather-Themed Backgrounds



*Use the same weather data to swap out the sky/stadium background image‚Äîshow raindrops and storm clouds for wet races, soft flurries or snowy landscapes for snowy conditions, etc., to boost immersion.
By layering in celebratory animations, real-time data, and weather-aware mechanics (both visual and functional), the app would feel far more dynamic, replayable, and engaging‚Äîjust like a real racing season!



Thank you for your consideration in advance.
